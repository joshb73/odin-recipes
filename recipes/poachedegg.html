        <p>Here's a new and improved version of our poached egg 
            method. Nothing too complicated here; we pretty much 
            poach eggs like everybody else, except we've got a 
            little step in the middle that makes it easier if 
            you're doing this for a larger group.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon champagne vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs, as fresh as possible</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a bowl with ice water</li>
            <li>Fill a saucepan with cold water and place over 
                medium heat; stir in vinegar and salt. Bring to 
                a gentle, slow simmer and reduce heat to low.
            </li>
            <li>Break each egg into a separate small ramekin; 
                place a ramekin close to the surface of the 
                water and gently pour egg into the simmering 
                water. Let egg white set for a minute or two 
                and use a silicone spatula to gently lift egg 
                from the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. 
                Cook until white is firm and yolk is runny, 
                about 6 minutes.
           </li>
           <li>Lift poached egg from water using a slotted spoon 
            and transfer gently to bowl of ice water to stop the 
            cooking process. Reheat eggs for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes 
            in very gently simmering water and remove with a 
            slotted spoon. Tap bottom of slotted spoon containing 
            egg on a dry paper towel to remove any excess water 
            before serving.

        </ol>
